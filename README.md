# silly, tiny, web apps

This is home to small (very) web dev projects I did to either practice or in completion of a course. For now there is absolutely no standard whatsoever except the fact I make my gf try some of these and we have our fun.

## repository structure

Every branch is a new set of a project that can be deployed on GitHub pages. I am still too lazy to organize them in one branch...

## currently live: a timer design

*For the first time in forever, the `timer` branch/demo also has [its own sort of write-up](https://tonsz.bearblog.dev/timer-project/) for the resources.*
